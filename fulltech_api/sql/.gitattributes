# SQL Migrations - Best Practices Reminders

# All .sql migration files should be treated as immutable once applied
# This doesn't enforce read-only in git, but serves as a reminder
# Never edit migrations that have been applied - create new ones instead

# Mark SQL files with specific attributes for better diffs
*.sql text eol=lf

# Log any attempts to modify old migrations (use git hooks if needed)
# See SQL_MIGRATIONS_BEST_PRACTICES.md for workflow details
